# Textures Folder

This folder should contain the texture file for the 3D model:
- `material_0_baseColor.png`

## Current Status
The texture file is missing, but the player model will render with a fallback red color (#ff6b6b) to match the Red Panda theme.

## To Add Texture
If you have the original texture file, place it here as `material_0_baseColor.png` and the model will automatically use it.
